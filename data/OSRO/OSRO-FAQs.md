##### HOW DO I BECOME A REFEREE?

First, we’re happy you’re here! Here are the steps to becoming a referee:

**Register for a course:**  
Select a course from our list of upcoming events and register to take the course.  
Referees must be 13 years or older to attend.

**Complete the online training:**  
Complete the online training modules from US Soccer before attending the in-person referee course.

Complete the online concussion training before attending the in-person referee course.

**Attend the in-person course:**  
Attend the in-person course, take and pass the referee test, and you’ll be a certified referee!

##### HOW DO I GET ASSIGNED TO GAMES?

Many of the assignors in Oregon use a website called [RefTown](https://www.reftown.com/) for assigning referees to games. We recommend that you register on RefTown so assignors will be able to schedule you to games or you can get involved in self assignment.  It’s perhaps the best way for referees to get in touch with assignors.

Please Note: If you are going to work for more than one organization/tournament, you will need to REGISTER for each one on Ref Town.

##### WHERE CAN I FIND THE LAWS OF THE GAME?

The Laws of the Game are updated frequently. You’ll review all updates and current Laws in your initial certification and recertification courses.

The Laws of the Game are also available as an app for both Android and iPhone users! It is recommended that all referees download it and have the app available at the field.

##### I NOTICED THAT THE REFEREE CREWS ON PROFESSIONAL GAMES OFTEN WEAR DIFFERENT JERSEYS THAN THOSE APPROVED BY U.S. SOCCER REFEREES LIKE ME. DOES THIS AFFECT ME IN ANY WAY?

No. For professional games in the United States, the leagues may have sponsorship commitments that require a different manufacturer to produce the uniforms, but the uniform itself must still comply with the basic standards set by U.S. Soccer. These new styles or designs should have no bearing on the standard uniform otherwise worn by U.S. Soccer referees. For international games, referees from other countries wear FIFA referee uniforms or uniforms approved by their home federation. If U.S. Soccer referees work an international game, they will wear the approved OSI uniform.

We’re glad to have you back! Recertification is done through U.S. Soccer’s Digital Learning Center. Visit the [“Recertify” page here!](https://www.oregonreferee.com/recertify)

##### WHAT DO I DO IF I'VE LOST MY REFEREE BADGE?

#### Where is my badge?

We will mail your badge out to the address in U.S. Soccer’s Digital Learning Center after you’ve complete all of your online coursework and attended the on-field training session. If you have not received your badge, please check the Digital Learning Center and make sure you have completed all your assignments.

If all your assignments have been completed, please ensure your mailing address is correct on your profile. If all looks good, and you have still not received your badge, please [contact our office](mailto:coordinator@oregonreferee.com).

If you have trouble accessing the site or entering the above code, please try the following suggestions:

1. Clear your browser history/cache
2. Access the site using either the Chrome or Firefox browser
3. Contact the ORC office for assistance

##### I'M STUCK ON A MODULE IN MY COURSE ON THE DIGITAL LEARNING CENTER! WHAT GIVES?

This is a very common question! The modules within your course often have videos that must be played in their entirety before you’re able to advance to the next section. Make sure all videos on the page have played from start to finish!

There are also many areas of the modules you will need to click on to get more information. Make sure all stars are clicked, and that every question is answered.

If the modules aren’t loading correctly or there seems to be a website issue, try the following troubleshooting tactics:

• Try deleting all the web browser’s temporary files (cookies/cache, etc.)• If you have another web browser installed on your device, log into the Learning Center in that browser and see if  
the problem persists  
• Try updating your web browser to the latest version  
• Try resetting your web browser to its default settings  
• If after trying all of these steps, your problem persists, try logging into the Learning Center on a different device altogether (laptop, phone, tablet). If that works, then another setting on your primary device is likely the cause  
of the problem.  
• Again, be sure to watch all of the videos through their entirety.

If the problems persist, contact the ORC office with screenshots of the issue and we will be happy to assist you!
