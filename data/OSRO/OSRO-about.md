# About < Oregon Soccer Referee Organization

The Oregon Soccer Referee Organization trains, develops, educates, and supports all of Oregon’s referees, ref mentors, ref coaches, and assignors in order to serve the US Soccer affiliated leagues and competitions in our state

The Organization is governed by a Board of Directors; however, the OSRO’s mission is accomplished by a number of volunteers and staff. With the exception of the Ombudsman, SRA, and SYRA, all volunteers and staff members are appointed and directed by the Board of Directors.
