## Leagues

OYSA runs sanctioned competitive leagues with various divisions in the Portland/Vancouver area.
U8-U10 competitions take place in the OYSA Developmental League which is also referred to as Development League and Development Academy.
There are two separate Developmental League programs: Developmental League for the Portland area, and Valley Academy League for north Willamette Valley, Oregon.

OYSA competitive league play in Portland is divided between U11-U15 which runs full year, and U16-U19 which is high school age and breaks during
the fall season so kids can play for their high school teams.

Elite soccer programs exist and have games in regional or national leagues such as MLSNext and ECNL.  These games are assigned by various organizations
and are usually invite-only for referees.

OYSA leagues have different assignors for different parts of the Portland/Vancouver metropolitan area.

## Rules of competition

The rules vary by league and tournament.
