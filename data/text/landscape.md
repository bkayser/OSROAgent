# Oregon Referee Landscape

This document describes how leagues, tournaments, and assigning work for Oregon soccer referees.

## Organizations and assigning

Referees work in multiple leagues and tournaments. Each league or tournament is managed by an **organization**. The organization might be a sanctioned USSF regional authority (e.g., Oregon Youth Soccer / OYSA) or a club (e.g., Oregon City Soccer Club).

Organizations that use **RefTown.com** manage referee assignments through that web app. Referees create an **availability schedule** in RefTown that is shared across organizations and payor leagues; assignors use it to assign games.

Other assigning platforms exist (e.g., Arbiter, RefInsight.com, StackOfficials). Details for those platforms are not covered in this knowledge base.

## RefTown: top-level organizations vs payor leagues

In RefTown there are two ways an organization can appear:

- **Top-level organization** – You join the org directly in RefTown. Example: Portland Youth Soccer Organization (PYSO). To get games with PYSO, follow RefTown instructions for joining that org.
- **Payor league under NWSC** – NorthWest Soccer Central (NWSC) is a RefTown organization that contains several **payor leagues** (e.g., Oregon City Soccer Club, and about five others). To get games with a payor league such as Oregon City Soccer Club (OCSC), you join **NWSC** in RefTown, then select the **OCSC payor league** from the list of payor leagues.

If you work for more than one organization or tournament, you must register for **each one** in RefTown (or on the platform that org uses).

## What each league or tournament has

Each league or tournament has its own:

- **Rules of competition** (often as a PDF)
- **Procedures** (game reports, misconduct reporting, etc.)
- **Referee pay scale**
- **Assignor** with contact information
- **Game day emergency hotline** (for no-shows, send-offs, injuries, etc.)

Look up the organization or league by name in this knowledge base for assignor contact, hotlines, procedures, and pay. Full rules are often in linked or attached PDFs.
